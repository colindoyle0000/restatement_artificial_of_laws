You are a legal researcher writing a Section of the {restatement_title}

Section title: {section_title}

Section description: {description}

A Section consists of three parts: a black-letter provision, Comment explicating, analyzing, and illustrating the black letter and its application, and a Reporter’s Notes explaining the sources relied upon in formulating the provision and its attendant Comment and setting forth its relationship to current law.

Your current project is to write the Comment for the issue of {section_title} in the law of {area_of_law}.

Your current task is to write an outline of the headings for the Comment.

You should draft this outline by relying upon the black-letter-law provision, the explanation for the black-letter-law provision, and your notes on the law. You should rely exclusively upon your notes on the law for information. Although your notes and explanation may characterize groups under different headings you should not include those headings in your output.

Purpose:

The purpose of the Comment is to explain the background law behind the provision and the details of how the provision works in practice.

Content and Organization:

Comment should be structured in a way that will most readily assist the reader to understand the provision. To the greatest extent possible, it should track the structure of the black letter, and both the headings and subject matter of a Comment’s subdivisions should be tied to the black letter’s central terms and concepts. Nothing should be introduced in the Comment that is not closely related to the provision.

The primary focus of the Comment should be the law of {area_of_law}. Other areas of law may be addressed to help clarify or contextualize the issue of {section_title} in the law of {area_of_law}, but the purpose of the Comment is not to explain other areas of law. Only address other areas of law after addressing {section_title} in the law of {area_of_law}.

Comment is normally subdivided into distinct components, each introduced by a separate lower-case italicized letter and heading describing the subject matter. If additional subdivision is called for, such components are introduced by parenthetical italicized numbers—(1), (2), etc.—and given their own headings. Even if there is no need to subdivide the Comment, its single component should be identified as Comment and given an appropriate heading.

Introductory components normally cover matters as scope, cross-references, rationale, and history or background. Subsequent components explicate and clarify in an orderly fashion the various components of the provision.

The Comment is also the appropriate place for identifying the competing considerations encapsulated in the black-letter provision. In clarifying the black letter’s meaning and scope, the Comment may frequently make explicit what is only implicit or suggested by the provision, but it should normally remain consistent with the provision. On rare occasions, however, it may be useful to employ Comment to forecast, suggest, or consider possible areas of legal development, presently inconsistent with the provision, for which there is no current precedent.

Components should address distinct considerations and should not be redundant.

Your final output should consist of the headings for each comment component. The format should be an alphabetical list with each heading on a separate line. All the text should be italicized. The output should include this list and no other text or commentary. The details within each heading will be filled in later.

Here are some examples from other Restatements of Law:

Restatement (Third) of Property 

Black letter law provision:

**§  2.2 Intestate Share of Surviving Spouse**

**An intestate decedent's surviving spouse takes a share of the intestate estate as provided by statute. The exact share differs among the states. Not infrequently, the spouse takes the entire intestate estate if the decedent leaves no surviving descendants or parents and, in some states, if the decedent also leaves no other specified relative such as a descendant of a parent. Older statutes tend to reduce the spouse's share to a fraction such as one-half or one-third when the decedent leaves a surviving descendant or another specified relative. Under the Revised Uniform Probate Code, the surviving spouse takes either the entire intestate estate or a specified lump sum plus a specified percentage of the excess, if any, depending on what other relatives survive the decedent.**

After reaching majority, the minor may either disaffirm or ratify the gift. The failure to disaffirm within a reasonable time after reaching majority constitutes a ratification of the gift.**

**(2) If a party's manifestation of assent is induced by either a fraudulent or a material misrepresentation by one who is not a party to the transaction upon which the recipient is justified in relying, the contract is voidable by the recipient, unless the other party to the transaction in good faith and without reason to know of the misrepresentation either gives value or relies materially on the transaction.**
