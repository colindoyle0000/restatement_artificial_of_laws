You are a legal researcher writing a Section of the {restatement_title}

Section title: {section_title}

Section description: {description}

Your current task is to take notes on improvements that could be made to the first draft of the black-letter law provision for {section_title} in the law of {area_of_law} to make the provision more logical, more internally consistent, and be less repetitive. 

A black-letter provision normally consists of a single rule, principle, or statement of law or of an integrally related series of rules, principles, or statements. The provision should be a legal rule that governs the essential aspects of {section_title} in the law of {area_of_law}. The provision’s scope should be consistent with and limited to the title and the project description. 

The provision should be a precise legal rule governing {section_title} in the law of {area_of_law} that a court can adopt and apply directly to a legal case. Provisions should be written in the present tense and should be a clear, precise, and succinct statement of a legal rule. This provision should be written with the care and precision of a well-drawn statute, phrased in the descriptive language of an appellate judge announcing the legal rule to be applied in a given case. Terminology should be consistent throughout the provision. Precision matters more than clarity. Legal terms of art should be used when necessary. Because Restatements aim to “restate” legal propositions as precisely and coherently as possible, any departures from standard, well-established terminology should be carefully considered.

Your job is not to provide suggestions for additional material to include in the provision.

Your output should be a series of specific edits that someone editing the provision could directly adopt. If you suggest that certain parts of the provisions be rewritten, provide the exact language of the rewrite.

Restatement (Third) of Property:

**§  2.2 Intestate Share of Surviving Spouse**

**An intestate decedent's surviving spouse takes a share of the intestate estate as provided by statute. The exact share differs among the states. Not infrequently, the spouse takes the entire intestate estate if the decedent leaves no surviving descendants or parents and, in some states, if the decedent also leaves no other specified relative such as a descendant of a parent. Older statutes tend to reduce the spouse's share to a fraction such as one-half or one-third when the decedent leaves a surviving descendant or another specified relative. Under the Revised Uniform Probate Code, the surviving spouse takes either the entire intestate estate or a specified lump sum plus a specified percentage of the excess, if any, depending on what other relatives survive the decedent.**



Restatement (Third) of Property:

**§  8.2 Incapacity Due to Minority**

​	**(a) A minor does not have capacity to make a will. A purported will made by a minor is void.**

​	**(b) A minor does not have capacity to make a gift. A purported gift made by a minor is voidable, not void. Before reaching majority, the minor may disaffirm the gift. After reaching majority, the minor may either disaffirm or ratify the gift. The failure to disaffirm within a reasonable time after reaching majority constitutes a ratification of the gift.**

​	**(c) For purposes of this section, a “minor” is a person who has not reached the age of majority or the age of capacity for the purpose in question and who is not emancipated. The age of majority is 18, unless an applicable statute provides otherwise.**



Restatement (Second) of Property:

**§  12.2 Scope of the Donee's Authority**

**The scope of the donee's authority as to appointees and the time and manner of appointment is unlimited except to the extent the donor effectively manifests an intent to impose limits.**



Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment:

**§  7 Mistaken Performance of Another's Obligation**

**Mistaken performance of another's obligation gives the performing party a claim in restitution against the obligor to the extent of the benefit mistakenly conferred on the obligor.**



Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment:

**§  34 Mistake or Supervening Change of Circumstances**

**(a) A person who renders performance under a contract that is subject to avoidance by reason of mistake or supervening change of circumstances has a claim in restitution to recover the performance or its value, as necessary to prevent unjust enrichment. If the case is one in which the requirements of § 54 can be met, the remedy of rescission and restitution permits the reversal of the transaction without the need to demonstrate unjust enrichment.**

**(b) For purposes of subsection (a):**

​	**(1) the value of a nonreturnable contractual performance is measured by reference to the recipient's contractual expectations; and**

​	**(2) the recipient's liability in restitution may be reduced to allow for loss incurred in reliance on the contract.**
