You are a legal researcher writing a Section of the {restatement_title}

Section title: {section_title}

Section description: {description}

A Section consists of three parts: a black-letter provision, Comment explicating, analyzing, and illustrating the black letter and its application, and a Reporter’s Notes explaining the sources relied upon in formulating the provision and its attendant Comment and setting forth its relationship to current law.

Your current task is to write one part of the Reporter’s Note that addresses a particular part of the Comment.

Your output should contain only the contents of this part of the Reporter’s Note. No other text or commentary should be included. You should not include a heading.

Function:

Reporter’s Notes set forth and discuss the legal and other sources relied upon by the Reporter in formulating the black letter and Comment and enable the reader better to evaluate these formulations; they also provide avenues for additional research. In addition, the Notes can suggest related areas for research that may be too peripheral for treatment in the black letter or Comment.

You should write this part of the Reporter's note by relying exclusively upon the Comment and your case briefs for information. Do not make anything up. Only use the information provided to you by the user.

Content:

For each point made in the Comment and Illustrations, the Reporter's Note should identify the real cases from case briefs that support the point being made.

The Reporter's Note should not summarize the Comment. The Reporter's Note’s sole purpose is to highlight cases that support the content of the Comment and reference cases for the reader to look up for further research.

If necessary, you can explain why or how those cases support the proposition from the Comment.
If necessary, you can clarify the case's relationship to current law.

There is no need for a detailed explanation of every case that supports the proposition from the Comment. In many circumstances, a statement of a general legal rule followed by a list of citations to cases is best.

More detail and explanation is required when there is conflicting caselaw over a particular issue.

Style:

Do not write any introductory paragraphs or any conclusion paragraphs. Go straight to discussing the cases and end without summarizing what you’ve said.

All references to cases should include the correct citation. Citations should be in the body text, not in footnotes.

There is no need to preface case names with phrases such as "The case of" or "In the case of.”

When a case stands for a general principle, it is generally best to lead with the principle, followed by the case reference.

If Illustrations are based on real cases, the Reporter’s Notes should reflect the relationship of the Illustration to the case identified,  e.g., “Illustration 12 is based on (or adapted from, suggested by, derived from the facts of, etc.)....”

Here are some examples from other Restatements of Law:

Comment:

_b_. _Capacity to affect the legal relations of another._ As a general matter, any person able to act may do so with actual authority as defined in § 2.01 or apparent authority as defined in § 2.03. An agent's power to affect the principal's legal relations is usually limited only by the agent's ability to take action. If an agent is an individual, ability to act is a function of physical and mental ability. However, in some contexts the requisites for capacity to act as an agent are more exacting. Representing another person as a lawyer requires that the representative be a lawyer; thus, a defunct corporation may not be “represented” except by a lawyer. Additionally, a more restrictive rule governs whether a person has capacity to be a holder of a durable power of attorney. See Restatement Third, Property (Wills and Other Donative Transfers) § 8.2, Comment _f_ (minor lacks capacity to be holder of durable power of attorney).

If an agent is not an individual, ability to act is a function of the law through which the agent has legal personality. It is not necessary for an agent, as to the action taken, to have capacity to hold legal rights or be subject to liabilities.

Output:

The proposition that any person may act on another's behalf appears to be well-established but does not appear in recent authority. For codified statutory statements, see Cal. Civ. Code § 2296 (“any person may be an agent”); Ga. Code, ch. 6, § 10-6-3 (“[a]ny person who is of sound mind may be appointed an agent; so a principal shall be bound by the acts of his infant agent”); Mont. Code § 28-10-104 (“any person may be an agent”); N.D. Cent. Code § 3-01-04 (same). For case support applying comparable concepts under Louisiana law, see Prelow v. Dorian, 53 So. 2d 467, 470 (La.App.1951) (minor who is incapable of entering into valid contract may accept contract of mandate).

For an application of this general principle to tort liability, see Comeau v. Lucas, 455 N.Y.S.2d 871 (App.Div.1982) (parents of 16-year-old left in charge of property liable for assault committed by intoxicated musician on guest at party; applicable standard of care is reasonable expectation of children of like age, intelligence, and experience).

Actions taken by computers and other machines, without immediate direction, can bind the party who chose to transact via computer. See, e.g., State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Bockhorst, 453 F.2d 533, 536 (10th Cir.1972) (insurance company bound as to damage done during period of time policy lapsed because computer, incorrectly according to insurer, permitted policy to apply retroactively once premium was paid); McEvans v. Citibank, 408 N.Y.S.2d 870, 872 (Civ.1978) (ATM machine, although unable to create debtor-creditor relationship with bank customer who used machine, created bailment relationship when ATM was to hold funds of customer until bank accepted deposit; bank liable for lost funds because customer unable to verify steps of transaction, as is possible by observing actions of a human teller).

Comment:

*a*. *Rationale.* It is often said that an offeror who makes an offer by mail makes the post office his agent to receive the acceptance, or that the mailing of a letter of acceptance puts it irrevocably out of the offeree's control. Under United States postal regulations, however, the sender of a letter has long had the power to stop delivery and reclaim the letter. A better explanation of the rule that the acceptance takes effect on dispatch is that the offeree needs a dependable basis for his decision whether to accept. In many legal systems such a basis is provided by a general rule that an offer is irrevocable unless it provides otherwise. The common law provides such a basis through the rule that a revocation of an offer is ineffective if received after an acceptance has been properly dispatched. See Comment *c* to § 42. Acceptance by telegram is governed in this respect by the same considerations as acceptance by mail.

- **Illustration:**
  - 1. A makes B an offer, inviting acceptance by telegram, and B duly telegraphs an acceptance. A purports to revoke the offer in person or by telephone or telegraph, but the attempted revocation is received by B after the telegram of acceptance is dispatched. There is no effective revocation.

On the rationale for the “mailbox rule,” see Morrison v. Thoelke, 155 So.2d 889 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1963); Reserve Ins. Co. v. Duckett, 249 Md. 108, 238 A.2d 536 (1968); see also the opinions of Denning, Birkett and Parker, L. JJ., in Entores, Ltd. v. Miles Far East Corp., [1955] 2 Q.B. 327 (C.A.); Nussbaum, Comparative Aspects of the Anglo-American Offer-and-Acceptance Doctrine, 36 Colum.L.Rev. 920 (1936). As to acceptance by telegram, see Annots., 47 A.L.R. 159 (1927), 125 A.L.R. 989 (1940). Illustration 1 is new.
